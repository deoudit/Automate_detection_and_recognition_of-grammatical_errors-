# Description of files
1.BLSTM.py : This code performs grammatical error detection with bidirectional long-short term memory model (Bi-LSTM).
2.You can initialize Bi-LSTM with word embeddings that cosider grammaticality and error patterns.
3.EWE.py, GWE.py and EandGWE.py : Their codes are the different methods of learning word embeddings.
4.functions.py, generators.py : The parts for other codes.
5.embedding.txt : This is the pre-trained word embeddings model that consider grammaticality and error patterns.
